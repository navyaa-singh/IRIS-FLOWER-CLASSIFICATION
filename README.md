# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION
This project applies fundamental Supervised Machine Learning techniques to classify three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements. We implemented and evaluated three distinct classification algorithms to identify the most accurate model for this classic multi-class prediction problem.
In week 1, we have downloaded the csv file of the dataset from kaggle.
